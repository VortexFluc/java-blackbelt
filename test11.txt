Had I the heavens embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim of the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half-light,
I would spread tje cloths under your feet:
But I being poor have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly, because you tread on my dreams
					William Butler Yeats
There are only two ways to live your live.
One is as though is a miracle. The other is as
though everything is a miracle.
